# CoolCookApp Project
## Project Description
CoolCookApp is a web application developed as a collaborative project for a university course. The main objective of the project was to assess teamwork and working in an Agile Scrum environment. The project involved a three-person team that delivered new functionalities every week.

CoolCookApp is designed to provide users with a collection of food recipes stored in a database and allow them to add their own recipes. The application includes the following requirements:

- User registration and login system
- Displaying recipes with details such as calorie count, ingredients, and preparation instructions
- Adding new recipes to the database
- Searching for recipes based on specific criteria
- Searching for recipes based on user-selected ingredients
- Home page showcasing the application's features
  
## Technologies Used
The project utilizes the following technologies:

- Vue.js: The CoolCookApp is built using Vue.js, a progressive JavaScript framework that facilitates the development of interactive web applications.
- Vuetify: Vuetify, a material design component framework for Vue.js, is employed for creating a visually appealing and consistent user interface.
- Firebase: Firebase serves as the backend infrastructure for the application, providing real-time data synchronization, secure authentication, and scalable storage capabilities.
- SCSS: SCSS (Sass) is used as a preprocessor for CSS, allowing for the creation of maintainable and customizable styles.
- Vuex: Vuex, a state management pattern and library for Vue.js, is used to manage the application's state and ensure smooth data flow between components.

CoolCookApp showcases the effective use of Vue.js, Vuetify, Firebase, SCSS, and Vuex to develop a user-friendly and feature-rich recipe application. The project's iterative development approach following Agile Scrum principles allowed for continuous improvement and the delivery of new functionalities each week.
